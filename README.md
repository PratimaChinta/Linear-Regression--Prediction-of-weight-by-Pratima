# Linear-Regression--Prediction-of-weight-by-Pratima
Regression analysis makes use of mathematical models to describe relationships. For example, suppose that height was the only determinant of body weight. If we were to plot height (the independent or 'predictor' variable) as a function of body weight (the dependent or 'outcome' variable), we might see a very linear relationship and describe this relationship with the equation for a line, Y = c+ m(x), where 'c' is the Y-intercept and 'm' is the slope of the line. We could use the equation to predict weight if we knew an individual's height.
I have uploaded the ipynb colab notebook file and dataset that i have found on kaggle.
